( https://docs.docker.com/get-started/swarm-deploy/)

Here you will use same folder/project which we use in (Docker images and container of this

file)

Make sure that Swarm is enabled on your Docker Desktop by typing docker system info,

and looking for a message Swarm: active(you might have to scroll up a little).

If Swarm isn’t running, simply type docker swarm initin a shell prompt to set it up.

Describe apps using stack files

Let’s write a simple stack file to run and manage our bulletin board. Place the following in a

filecalled bb-stack.yaml

version: '3.7'

services:bb-app:

image: bulletinboard:1.0ports:

- "8000:8080"

Deploy and check your application

1. Deploy your application to

docker stack deploy -c bb-stack.yaml demo

If all goes well, Swarm will report creating all your stack objects with no complaints:

2.Make sure everything worked by listing your service

1. docker service ls

2) If all has gone well, your service will report with 1/1 of its replicas created:

1. Open a browser and visit your bulletin board at localhost:8000; you should see

your bulletin board, the same as when we ran it as a stand-alone container in

Docker imagesand containersection of this file.

2. Once satisfied, tear down your

applicationdocker stack rm demo
